# Trafilea Exercise

## The challenge
This exercise challenges you to develop a RESTful API with functionalities similar to a
specific logic while adhering to certain constraints.
##Â Objective
Implement an API that categorizes and stores numbers based on their divisibility by
3 and 5, mimicking the logic described below:
- Numbers divisible by 3: Categorized as "Type 1"
- Numbers divisible by 5: Categorized as "Type 2"
- Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5: Categorized as "Type 3"
- Other numbers: Stored as their original value.
## Constraints
Utilize only one if statement within the core logic. Avoid else, else if, ternary operators, or switch statements.
## Functional Requirements
- Data Storage:
    - The API shall store numbers and their classifications in memory or any other support you consider appropriate.
- Classifications include:
    - Numbers divisible by 3: Categorized as "Type 1"
    - Numbers divisible by 5: Categorized as "Type 2"
    - Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5: Categorized as "Type 3"
    - Other numbers: Stored as their original value
